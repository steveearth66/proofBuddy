   <p>"Proof Buddy" is a browser based tool designed to teach proof writing to beginning computer science students. It has been designed from the ground up with educational purposes in mind and has been used successfully with hundreds of students since January 2022 at Drexel University. The tool helps students build and check proofs in a variety of systems.
It is capable of doing Natural Deduction (both boolean logic and first order logic) and the ability to do Equational Reasoning with program code is currently being implemented. Important features for the teacher are that they can create assignments of proof problems, which the software can auto score 
and have results uploaded into their school's LMS.  Moreover, because the tool allows Instructors (and students!) to create their own lemmas, this permits a customization of the axiom system. Future extensions plan to include submission analysis, a hint system, and automatic question generation. By 2023, Proof Buddy should even include Induction and other common proof techniques!</p>
